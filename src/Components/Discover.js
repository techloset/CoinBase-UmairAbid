          The next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending
          ports. This could be a place close to home and sail in one area or
          start and finish at two different ports. Generally, starting and
          stopping in the same port will save you money and is usually more
          convenient. You can also fly to a destination far from home and then
          sail another exotic sea. There are luxury yacht charter companies that
          cruise the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas or around Alaska, the
          Panama Canal, or anyplace you can imagine.
        </p>

          Determining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a
          chartered yachting trip. You can have as little or many crew members
          as the ship will hold. A captain takes all the worries out of
          navigating and onboard housekeeping services make it a real vacation
          that rivals the finest hotel services. You can also choose to have a
          chef and service crew as part of your vacation package.

            If you like the idea of knowing what it is really like to sail, but
            don`t want to risk safety, you can charter a sailing cruise that
            puts you in the role of deck hand. A competent crew will direct you
            as to your “chores” for keeping the ship in top shape and on course.{" "}

            Destinations & Ports of important Charter Companies One of the
            greatest benefits of choosing a chartered cruise as a vacation is
            the choice. You will most likely have a rough itinerary and that can
            be affected by weather. However, you are flexible in deciding how
            long you want to stay in a particular port and if you want to add or
            subtract stops along the way.

          Your yacht is your hotel that travels with you. There is only one
          flight and one hotel to book! Then you take all of your luggage and
          unpack it just once to enjoy several days of new destinations.
        </p>

          If you have never experienced cruising before, a chartered experience
          is a great way to get your feet wet. It is different from cruise lines
          with thousands of guests because the people on your ship will be your
          friends and family. The personal touches of a chartered trip will help
          you develop your love for the sea with all the best benefits of
          commercial cruises.
